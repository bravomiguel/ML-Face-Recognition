Setting up environment to run the python code
---------------------------------------------------

1) Unzip my coursework submission folder (containing my code) on your laptop; somewhere easily accessible from your command line (e.g. your desktop)
2) Download and install the anaconda python distribution (if you haven't done so already) using the following link: https://www.anaconda.com/distribution/
3) Make sure to download the Python 3.7 version, and select the right option for your operating system (Windows, macOS, Linux)
4) Open your command line (Terminal for Mac, Anaconda Command Prompt for Windows), and navigate to the code subfolder in the coursework submission folder, using this command:

cd <coursework submission folder address>/code 

5) In the command line, run the following commands to create a virtual environment with all the necessary packages to run the python code: 

# create new environment
conda env create -f environment.yml;
# activate the environment
conda activate Cvcoursework2020;
# delete opencv-python and install opencv-contrib-python
pip uninstall opencv-python -y;
pip install opencv-contrib-python==3.4.2.17 --force-reinstall;

6) In the command line, run the following command to open jupyter notebook:

jupyter notebook

7) You can now open and execute the .ipynb files (containing the python code) to perform each part of the pipeline as required.
